# React template for Beam dAPP UI

Beam dAPPs consist of three parts:

1. On chain contract (called contract shader) - deployed on the blockchain (similar to Ethereum smart contracts)
2. Application shader - runs within the wallet or web page and acts as an API adapter for the on chain contract
3. The application UI - a standard web application built using any modern web framework (React, Vue etc...)

In this repository we provide a React template to get started with building UI for Beam applications

Follow [DEVELOPING BEAM DAPP UI guide](https://beam.mw/en/docs/dev/developing-beam-dapp-ui/) to get started

Check out some of the existing applications for examples and reference
* [Beam DEX](https://github.com/BeamMW/dex-app)
* [Beam Asset Minter](https://github.com/BeamMW/asset-minter-app)
